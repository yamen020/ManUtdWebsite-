    <h2>How It All Began</h2>
    <p>Manchester United was founded in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club. The name was changed to Manchester United in 1902 after financial struggles were resolved by new investors. This marked the beginning of the club's transformation into a powerhouse.</p>

    <h2>The Busby Babes & Tragedy</h2>
    <p>Under Sir Matt Busby, a team of young stars emerged in the 1950s, famously known as the "Busby Babes". In 1958, tragedy struck with the Munich Air Disaster, claiming the lives of 23 people, including 8 players. The club was devastated but rebuilt with resilience.</p>

    <h2>The Ferguson Era</h2>
    <p>Appointed in 1986, Sir Alex Ferguson led the club through its most successful period. Between 1993 and 2013, United won 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups, and 2 UEFA Champions League trophies. His leadership established United as a global football giant.</p>

    <h2>Modern Day United</h2>
    <p>Post-Ferguson, the club entered a transitional period, yet continued to compete at the highest level. Highlights include the 2017 Europa League win and ongoing campaigns in the Premier League and Europe under new management and young talents.</p>
